I'm writing this based off of my limited experience writing [Easy Rsync](https://github.com/Teknicallity/easy-rsync/tree/main), scouring the [Unraid programming forum](https://forums.unraid.net/forum/57-programming/), and dissecting other plugins. There are bound to be mistakes on how the plugin system works.
